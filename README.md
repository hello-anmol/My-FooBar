# FooBar
The Repository Contains Questions And Answers To My Foo.Bar Challenge

## What Is This About
I was fortunate enough to be invited for the google Foo.Bar challenge. After thorough three months, I've finally finished all the levels of the Foo.Bar challenge.

The code organisation is very simple:

```
--- Level
	--- Problem
		--- constraints.txt
		--- problem.txt
		--- solution.py
```

Each problem directory contains three files namely,

- `constraints.txt`: This includes the limitations for the problem; this is mostly same throughout.
- `problem.txt`: This includes the description of the problem along with two example test cases.
- `solution.py`: This files contains my solution written in Python3.

NOTE: It is advisable to attempt the problems yourself before looking at the solutions.

## References

I would like to accept that I've used a lot of online resources, tutorials and mathematical tools to solve the problems as they provide a great learning experience and meant to make us learn while doing.
